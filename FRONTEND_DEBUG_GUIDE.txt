## Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete** in your browser
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Delete data"
4. OR use **Ctrl + F5** to force refresh the page

## Step 2: Open Developer Tools
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Keep this open while testing

## Step 3: Test Step by Step

### Test 1: Page Load
1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Check console for initialization messages:
   - Should see: "🔧 Initializing file upload components"
   - Should see: "File input element: HTMLInputElement"
   - Should see: "File upload area element: HTMLDivElement"

### Test 2: Login as Ops User
1. Click "Login" button
2. Select "Ops User" tab
3. Enter:
   - Email: ops@example.com
   - Password: ops123
4. Click "Login"
5. Check console for login messages:
   - Should see: "🔐 Login attempt: ops ops@example.com"
   - Should see: "✅ Login successful, token stored: Yes"

### Test 3: File Selection
1. In the Ops Dashboard, click on the upload area
2. Check console for:
   - Should see: "📁 Upload area clicked, triggering file input"
3. Select a .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx file
4. Check console for:
   - Should see: "📁 File selection event triggered"
   - Should see: "📁 Selected file: File"
   - Should see: "📁 Input files count: 1"

### Test 4: File Upload
1. After selecting a file, click "Upload File" button
2. Check console for:
   - Should see: "🔧 File upload started"
   - Should see: "Auth token: [token]"
   - Should see: "File input element: HTMLInputElement"
   - Should see: "File input files: FileList"
   - Should see: "Selected file: File"

## If You Still Get Errors:

### Error: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'files')"
**Solution**: The file input wasn't found. Try:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + F5)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Make sure you're on the Ops Dashboard page

### Error: "No files in file input"
**Solution**: File wasn't properly selected. Try:
1. Click the upload area again
2. Select a file with correct extension (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx)
3. Make sure the file is under 16MB

### Error: "File input element not found"
**Solution**: JavaScript timing issue. Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Wait 2-3 seconds before trying to upload
3. Check if you're logged in as Ops user

## Alternative Test Method:
If frontend still doesn't work, you can test via API directly:
```bash
# Run this in PowerShell to test upload API
C:\Users\ayush\OneDrive\Desktop\Divansh\.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_upload_direct.py
```
